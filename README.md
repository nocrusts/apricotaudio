What is apricot?
----------------

Apricot is an audio player written in Python designed to easily play most audio files. The GUI has been modelled after similar "simple" applications, such as mpv, and is designed to be accessible, intuitive, and quick. 

Dependencies
------------

Apricot depends on pydub and simpleaudio, which are both included in requirements.txt. Additionally, Apricot requires python3-gi or an equivalent package.

Current Issues
------

Apricot is a new application that would significantly benefit from community contribution and testing. Please feel free to provide insight!

Patched: ~~Some files sound distorted when played with apricot, this is currently being actively investigated.
